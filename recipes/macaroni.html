        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dog food recipe substitutes macaroni noodles for the usual rice or oats â€” but still includes plenty of healthy protein and vegetables. Cook up your ground turkey, broccoli, and sweet potatoes, and you'll have a delicious, human-grade dog entree.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Ground turkey</li>
            <li>Sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Zucchini squash</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>All-Natural chicken stock or water</li>
            <li>Macaroni noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook turkey: In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add ground turkey, begin to break it down, and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until mostly cooked through.</li>

            <li>Chop veggies: With a food processor, finely chop sweet potatoes, carrots, zucchini and broccoli.</li>
            
            <li>Add vegetables and stock: Add in the chopped vegetables and chicken stock (or water). Cook on a strong simmer for 7-8 minutes, or until veggies are tender and cooked through.</li>
            
            <li>Stir in pasta: Mix in your cooked pasta noodles to the turkey vegetable mixture.</li>
            
            <li>Feed your pups: Portion out meals accordingly. For every 10 lbs, you need roughly 1/2 cup of food per meal. </li> 
        </ol>
